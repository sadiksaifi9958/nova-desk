# NovaDash

A modern, responsive admin dashboard built with React and styled with shadcn/ui. NovaDash demonstrates a complete frontend architecture — authentication flow, protected routing, global state management, dark mode, and data visualization — all built from scratch using current React best practices.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Authentication flow** — login, logout, and persisted sessions via `localStorage`
- 🛡️ **Protected routes** — unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to the login page
- 🌗 **Dark mode** — fully themed light/dark mode with no flash-of-incorrect-theme on load
- 📊 **Data visualization** — revenue and traffic charts built with Recharts
- 📋 **Data tables** — sortable, styled user management table with status badges
- 🧭 **Client-side routing** — nested routes with lazy-loaded pages and Suspense fallbacks
- 🗂️ **Global state management** — Context API + `useReducer` for auth/theme, Zustand for UI state
- 🔄 **Async data fetching** — simulated API calls using TanStack React Query, with loading states and caching
- ✅ **Form validation** — real-time validation feedback on the login form
- 🎨 **Custom design system** — built on shadcn/ui's component library with a tailored Zinc theme

## 🎯 Key Architectural Decisions

- **Context API vs. Zustand**: Context manages slow-changing, app-wide state (auth, theme), while Zustand handles fast-changing UI state (sidebar toggling) — avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
- **Protected routing**: A dedicated `ProtectedRoute` component gates access to authenticated pages, redirecting unauthenticated users before any protected content renders.
- **Theme persistence**: Theme preference is saved to `localStorage` and applied via an inline script in `index.html`, preventing a flash of the wrong theme on page load.
- **Lazy loading**: Each page is code-split with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`, reducing the initial bundle size.

## 📌 Note on Data

This project uses simulated data (hardcoded arrays and mock async functions) to demonstrate frontend patterns like data fetching, loading states, and caching — there is currently no backend or real database. Login accepts any valid-format email and password (no real account verification).
